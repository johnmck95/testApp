# Kettlebll Tracker

A little side project to gain some experience working with Firebase.

This repo has lots of ugly unmaintainable code. Rather than making something polished, I wanted to rapidly develop a barebones app to track my kettlebell workouts more easily. Google auth sign-in so feel free to poke around and use it if you'd like!
